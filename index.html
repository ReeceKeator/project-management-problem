    <h1>Problem Statement: Lack of Real-Time Communication in Project Management</h1>
    <p>In our current project management workflow, there is a lack of real-time communication among team members, which leads to delays in decision-making and missed deadlines. The absence of an integrated messaging tool within the project management platform has significantly reduced team efficiency and project transparency. Our goal is to implement a real-time messaging feature that will enable faster communication and reduce project delays by 25%.</p>
